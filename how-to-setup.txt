HOW-TO SETUP FROM FORMANDDATA2. 

in settings, add app_name to "INSTALLED_APPS"
in project urls.py, from django.urls import include
add:
    path('', include("app1.urls")),

create templates folder, and app_name subfolder. 
create forms1.html and copy from <body> to </body>
create submitted.html, add html:5, and add a brief submitted message. 

in app folder:
copy forms.py, models.py, urls.py, views.py

AND YOU'RE DONE!

To put the form on a page that is not the homepage, you can adjust the urls and create html docutments 
and views as appropriate, and then simply erase "action" paramater in <form> block in the forms1.html 
file. If this action paramater is stated, you cannot have a form unless it is on the root directory of the website.
